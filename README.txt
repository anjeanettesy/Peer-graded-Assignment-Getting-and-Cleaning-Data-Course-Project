# UCI HAR Dataset Analysis

This repository contains scripts and files for analyzing the UCI HAR (Human Activity Recognition) Dataset. The dataset includes measurements of various activities performed by subjects wearing smartphones. The analysis aims to clean and transform the data into a tidy format for further investigation.

## Files

- **CodeBook.md**: Provides detailed information about the variables, data, and transformations performed during data cleaning and preparation.
- **run_analysis.R**: R script that performs the data cleaning and transformation steps on the UCI HAR Dataset. It produces a tidy data set.
- **FinalDF.txt**: The output file generated by the `run_analysis.R` script. It contains the final tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Data Analysis Steps

The analysis involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preparation**: Downloads and unzips the UCI HAR Dataset if not already available. Reads relevant files into data frames.

2. **Merge the Training and Test Sets**: Combines measurement data, activity code data, and subject ID data into a single data frame.

3. **Extract Mean and Standard Deviation Measurements**: Selects only the columns that contain mean and standard deviation measurements.

4. **Use Descriptive Activity Names**: Matches the activity codes with corresponding activity labels and replaces the activity codes in the data set.

5. **Label the Data Set with Descriptive Variable Names**: Modifies the column names in the data set to be more descriptive and meaningful.

6. **Create Tidy Data Set with Average Measurements**: Groups the data by subject and activity and calculates the mean of each variable across all columns for each group.

## How to Run the Analysis

To run the analysis:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the necessary files.

2. Open RStudio or any R environment.

3. Set the working directory to the location where the downloaded files are saved.

4. Run the `run_analysis.R` script.

5. After execution, the `FinalDF.txt` file will be generated, containing the tidy data set with average measurements.

Please refer to the **CodeBook.md** for a detailed explanation of the variables, data, and transformations performed during the analysis.
