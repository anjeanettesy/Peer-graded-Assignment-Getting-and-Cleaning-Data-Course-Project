Code Book:

This code performs various steps to clean up and transform the data from the UCI HAR Dataset. Here is a description of the variables, the data, and the transformations performed:

Step 1: Merge the training and test sets
- Variables:
  - X: Measurement data from the dataset
  - Y: Activity code data
  - Subject: Subject ID data

- Data:
  - X_test.txt and X_train.txt: Measurement data for test and training sets, respectively
  - Y_test.txt and Y_train.txt: Activity code data for test and training sets, respectively
  - subject_test.txt and subject_train.txt: Subject ID data for test and training sets, respectively

- Transformations:
  - The measurement data, activity code data, and subject ID data are combined using the `cbind()` function to create the merged data frame `mergedDF`.

Step 2: Extract mean and standard deviation measurements
- Variables:
  - TidyDF: Data frame to store the extracted measurements

- Transformations:
  - The `select()` function is used with the `matches()` function to extract columns containing "mean" or "std" in their names from `mergedDF`. The resulting data frame is stored in `TidyDF`.

Step 3: Use descriptive activity names
- Variables:
  - activity_labels: Data frame containing activity labels

- Transformations:
  - The `merge()` function is used to match the activity codes in `TidyDF` with their corresponding activity labels in `activity_labels` based on the "Code" and "Id" columns, respectively. The resulting data frame is stored in `TidyDF`.
  - The "Code" column in `TidyDF` is replaced with the activity labels using assignment (`<-`) operation.

Step 4: Label the data set with descriptive variable names
- Transformations:
  - The `rename_with()` function is used with regular expressions and replacement patterns to modify column names in `TidyDF` and provide more descriptive labels. Multiple `rename_with()` functions are chained together to apply the transformations iteratively.

Step 5: Create a tidy data set with average measurements
- Variables:
  - FinalDF: Data frame to store the final tidy data set

- Transformations:
  - The `group_by()` function is used to group the data by "Subject" and "Activity".
  - The `summarise(across())` function is used to calculate the mean of each variable across all columns for each group.
  - The `ungroup()` function is used to remove the grouping information.
  - The resulting data frame is stored in `FinalDF`.

Additional steps:
- The `write.table()` function is used to write the final tidy data set (`FinalDF`) to a file called "FinalDF.txt" with row names excluded.

This code performs the necessary data cleaning and transformation steps to create a tidy data set that can be used for further analysis.
